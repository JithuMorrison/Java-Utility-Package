# Java-Utility-Package
A package created by me for easy usage
This Java class A provides utility methods for input/output operations similarly to python, mathematical calculations, and data manipulation with custom types for strings (Str) and integers (Int) - use "import static Jithu.A.*;" to use A class
The Mix class implements a doubly linked list that can store nodes of different data types (int, String, double) and provides methods for creating the list, adding, deleting, inserting, reversing nodes, and displaying the list's size and contents.
The List class contains static methods to create and initialize instances of the Int and Str
The Int class provides methods for managing and manipulating an array of integers, including searching, reversing, copying, appending, sorting, inserting, and removing elements.
The Str class defines various methods for managing and manipulating an array of strings, including searching, reversing, copying, appending, sorting, inserting, and removing elements.
The Matrix class allows for the creation and manipulation of a 2D integer matrix
